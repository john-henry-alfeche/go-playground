Welcome to my **GoLang Playground**!  
This repository is a personal space where I practice Go concepts daily, following a 30-day learning plan.

## üìö About

I'm learning Go from the book **"Head First Go"** and documenting my journey here.  
Each folder or file will correspond to lessons, exercises, or mini-projects I build along the way.
