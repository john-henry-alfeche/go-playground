# Go Playground 🏗️

Welcome to my **GoLang Playground**!
This repository is a personal space where I practice Go concepts daily, following a 30-day learning plan.

## 📚 About

I'm learning Go from the book **"Head First Go"** and documenting my journey here.
Each folder or file will correspond to lessons, exercises, or mini-projects I build along the way.

## 📅 30-Day Plan Overview

- **Week 1**: Basics (variables, types, I/O)
- **Week 2**: Logic (conditionals, loops, functions)
- **Week 3**: Small projects (CLI tools, error handling)
- **Week 4**: Advanced topics (structs, interfaces, concurrency)

## 🛠️ How to Run

Make sure you have [Go installed](https://golang.org/dl/).

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/john-henry-alfeche/go-playground.git
cd go-playground
